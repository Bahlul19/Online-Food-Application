				<p>A blog privacy policy is used to tell visitors to your blog about the kinds of information that is collected about them while they're on your blog. For most bloggers, a simple privacy policy like the sample blog privacy policy below is enough, but if you display third-party ads or collect and share any kind of information about your blog visitors such as email addresses, then you need to have a more explicit privacy policy that clearly explains what information you collect and how you use or share it.</p>
				<p>ood literature can be hard to categorize. Consequently bookshops struggle with exactly where to place such books on the shelves. This I know from bitter experience. All too often they get lumped in somewhere with the huge £25 hardback, recipe-led, TV-series-supporting tomes featuring gurning chefs looking slightly to one side on the cover. Food writing books then, are like remora fish, swimming along stuck to the bellies of much bigger beasts. </p>
				<p>But the beauty of ‘food writing’ is that because it straddles so many other genres (food and travel, food and memoir, food and journalism, food and history – even food and fiction) it gives authors a huge area to explore.  </p>
				<p>Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential was a watershed in 2000. A book that described the visceral pleasures of eating as much as it did the physical and mental abuse of working in a restaurant kitchen, contained not a single recipe. Since then many a chef has followed suit, each a dilution of that original idea. There is no more defunct sub-genre than the testosterone and booze-fuelled if-you-can’t-stand-the-heat-get-out-of-the-kitchen book.  </p>
				<h5>What Does Our Privacy Policy Include?</h5>  
				<p>The ballsy chef memoir is perhaps the best-known non-recipe food book. But there are stories everywhere. </p>
				<p>It seems to me our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others</p>
				<p>Before you can find the right words, it's important to examine the different sensations associated with food — namely appearance, texture, and taste.
					The appearance of a food is important because, like the cliché says, we all eat with our eyes. Making a food look appetizing is almost as important as how it tastes. Describing how it looks can be done in a number of different ways, but appearance can best be described with everything from simple colors (like "brown" or "green") to image-heavy adjectives (like "a sprinkle of sugar" or "a dab of butter"). </p>
				<h5>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h5>  
				<p>Another consideration for your food is texture. Whether your chicken tenders are crispy or your chocolate mousse is creamy, the proper texture can make or break a dish. Because of this, matching the right texture words to the right dishes is critical. Words like "succulent" and "tender" are ideal for savory dishes, while "creamy" and "fluffy" are great for desserts.

					The final and most obvious consideration is taste. The flavor of your food is typically what most people remember most often. Whether it's sweet, sour, savory, salty, or bitter, it will stay in a customer's memory. If filet mignon has the perfect taste, a customer will remember that. If it's over-salted, they'll remember that too. It's the basic premise of the whole foodservice industry — taste is king. The possibilities for describing a flavor are nearly endless. </p>
